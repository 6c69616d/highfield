To Highfield...

Thank you for allowing me the oppurtunity to undertake this exercise.

I'm not going to lie it was a challenge for myself.

I have done the best that I could and I was concious of wasting your time by getting more and more out of my depth with the task.

What I have created does not run as I just get an error saying the site can not be reached unfortunately.

Due to this I have been unable to test out what I have produced.

I really struggled with the task due to never starting a project like what you were after from scratch before.

I believe from research I have undertaken that one of the main problems is how I have tried to access the api that you provided but all the guides I could find
online suggested I had done it correctly so maybe i was researching the wrong root of the problem.

I also appreciate that although I create the topcoloursdtoviewmodel it is never used as what I wanted to achieve for the colours I was unable to assertain using the model. I wanted to do something similar to what I did for the ages which is probably what you wanted where there would of been multiple instances of the model in a list but I just couldn't get it work and therefore went for a dictionairy instead.

I have tried to demonstrate some of the techniques we discussed in the call on Monday i.e. Linq.

I tried to demonstrate some basic conventional commits and I probably should of demonstrated a better use of git from the start.

Please accept my apologies for how what I have produced may not be up to scratch the anxiety completing the task most certainly got the better of me.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
